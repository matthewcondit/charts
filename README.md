# Helm Repository for Custom Applications

Welcome to my Helm repository! This repository contains Helm charts for various applications where I couldn't find reliable sources elsewhere. These charts are free to use for anyone who needs them, and contributions are always welcome.

## Overview

This repository is designed to host custom Helm charts for deploying applications on Kubernetes clusters. The charts here are tailored to meet specific deployment needs that are not adequately addressed by existing Helm repositories.

## How to Use

### Adding this Repository

To add this Helm repository to your Helm client, run the following command:

```bash
helm repo add my-helm-repo https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/helm-charts/main/
helm repo update
```

### Available Charts

Currently, the following Helm charts are available in this repository:

1. **Netbox**: A Helm chart to deploy [Netbox](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/) in your Kubernetes cluster.

More charts will be added over time as I continue to develop and refine them.

### Deploying a Chart

To deploy an application using one of the Helm charts in this repository, run the following command:

```bash
helm install <release-name> my-helm-repo/<chart-name> --values <custom-values.yaml>
```

For example, to deploy Netbox:

```bash
helm install netbox my-helm-repo/netbox --values my-values.yaml
```

### Customizing the Deployment

Each chart comes with a `values.yaml` file where you can customize the deployment according to your needs. You can override any value by providing a custom `values.yaml` file or using `--set` commands when running `helm install` or `helm upgrade`.
